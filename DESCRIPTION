Description: Omics data (e.g. transcriptomics, proteomics,
    metagenomics...)  offer a detailed and multi-dimensional perspective
    on the molecular components and interactions within complex biological
    (eco)systems.  Analyzing these data requires adapted procedures, which
    are implemented as steps according to the 'recipes' package.
